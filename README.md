# Pricing Table

This project is a simple and responsive pricing table designed using HTML and CSS. It provides three different pricing plans: Starter, Freelance, and Professional. The design is minimal, clean, and adaptable to different screen sizes.

## Features

- **Styled Buttons:** Each plan includes a well-styled "Buy Now" button
- **Highlight Best Choice:** The Freelance plan is emphasized as the best choice
- **Custom Font:** Uses Google Fonts (Montserrat)
- **Icons for List Items:** Checkmarks (âœ”) indicate plan features

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structuring the pricing table
- **CSS3**: Styling, layout, and responsiveness
- **Google Fonts**: Montserrat for typography

## File Structure

```
|-- project-folder
